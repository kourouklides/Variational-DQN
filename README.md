# Variational DQN
This is done as a project for 
[Machine Learning with Probabilistic Programming](http://www.proditus.com/syllabus.html). The implementation uses Chainer, Tensorflow and Edward. Part of the Chainer code is borrowed from Chainer tutorial on DQN.

Variational DQN leverages variational inference subroutines to update DQN parameters.
